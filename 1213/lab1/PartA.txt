●In which package is the Rectangle class located?
- Package: java.awt


● What do you need to do in order to use the Rectangle class in your program? ● How many constructors does the Rectangle class have? 
- import java.awt.Rectangle;
- 7 Constructors


● Find the errors in the following statements:  
r = new Rectangle();  
"r = new Rectangle();" is incorrect because the variable type must be declared first, meaning it must be "Rectangle r = new Rectangle();"

r.translate(10, “Hello”); 
- "r.translate(10, "Hello");" is incorrect because the method requires two integers, and will not accept a string.
