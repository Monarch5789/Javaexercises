1). Special Features: Order an item(s). Create a member. View payment methods. View Member Profile. View Store Inventory.
2). Solution is complete, though there are limitations. All interactions will require a userID.
3). The easy parts of the assignment were sitting down and actually writing out the code, as well as going through and debugging. I think the more challenging part was designing it from the ground up in the first place, and figuring out what methods and constructors would go in what classes. 
4). Yes, I learned how to utilize ArrayLists to help create a temporary instance of an object in order to get information from an item in the ArrayList.

    Assignment Name: ITSC1213 Project 1 - Book Store
    Description: The purpose of this project is to create a system that allows a bookstore owner to keep track of their inventory and members.
    The program is currently capable of the following:
    1) Registering new members (and determining whether or not a new member is a premium member or not)
    2) Making an order of a number of CDs, DVDs, and Books (Note that inputting a number greater than the store's inventory will cause a transaction to be cancelled, though a record of the attempt will be left on the users profile)
    3) Viewing payment methods for each user (Whether or not they have decided to pay via a card or cash)
    4) Viewing a members profile, which will inform them if they are a premium member, the number of products they have purchased, as well as the total they have spent, and their payment method.
    5) Viewing the stores inventory.
    It should also be noted that all functions require an active user ID. Creating an order without a user will not work, nor will attempting to access the stores inventory.
